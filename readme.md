AIM:
This function is used to read the MQ135 Gas Sensor and send the value to the blynk application where this value is displayed on the gauge. This condition is used to send a notification message, if the Sensor value increases above 600.
 
MATERIALS REQUIRED:
NodeMCU ESP8266
mq135-gas sensor
pcb board
led-1
Arduino IDE
Blynk Application
Resisters
Capacitors
EXPLANATION:
IoT Smoke Detector- In this tutorial, you will learn how to make an IoT based Smoke Detector system using Nodemcu ESP8266 Wifi module, MQ135 Gas Sensor and Blynk application. The sensor value can be monitored in real time from anywhere around the world. When the sensor value crosses a certain pre-defined value a notification message is sent to the concerned person.
This is the MQ135 Gas Sensor which is quite sensitive to Benzene, Alcohol, and Smoke. The output voltage of this sensor increases as the concentration of the gases increases. This sensor is famous for the fast response and recovery. The sensitivity can be adjusted very easily using the blue color variable resistor
